### professional un-breaking service

We can help diagnose and correct issues as they arise, even if we didn't install or don't maintain the system. These services will be billed on a time-and-materials basis, and are typically envisioned as short-term problem solving and repair.

Over a longer term, break/fix services aren't cost beneficial to you, the end customer. (This is where we sell you on ongoing services.)
Between the downtime from affected systems and higher rates and hourly costs for site visits or equipment, maintenance contracts or [managed services]({{< relref "manage" >}}) are typically cheaper and more convenient over time.
