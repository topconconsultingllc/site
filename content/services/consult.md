### figuring it out

we love working with clients on the nitty-gritty of their tech stacks, be that a single home printer or multi-state setups. 
we can offer diagnostic services, consulting for new systems integrations, different workflows, or *whatever you need*!

technology can be a boon to productivity, but shiny new toys for their own sake can also be frustrating, inconvenient, and get in your way. 
if you have a new service you want to bring into your company's infrastructure but it's not fitting in well, let us help! 
we can consult with you about improvements and next steps, and give you an estimate for our work or the confidence to go and find the exact right contractor for your needs.

### operations

business operations and I.T. support hold a special place in our hearts, especially for small businesses.
we firmly believe that you, the small business owner, don't need to be brilliant at DNS updates and Raid configurations. 
you went into business for your own purposes, to share your own product - let us help you with this I.T. malarkey and integrating and expanding your systems to make your job easier.
