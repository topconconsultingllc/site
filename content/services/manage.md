summary: let us take care of the whole life cycle of any or all of your services

### ongoing updates, patches, and tlc

the term 'managed services' denotes the alternative of [break/fix]({{< relref "fix" >}}).
topcon  would assume responsibility for the ongoing maintenance and management of any system or service you'd like us to. 
examples include networks and firewalls, servers or hosted services, workstation management and end-user support, phone systems, etc. 

we would keep the system up-to-date, applying security patches and fixes as recommended by the vendor, and actively monitor the system for signs of early failure. 
this method is effective at preventing downtime before it affects productivity, as well as ensures that if something happens, we have access and control to effect quick repairs efficiently.
